Using IAPâ€™s Haskell functional programming rather than traditional programming tools, analysts can expect to:

- Cut code size by 30-80%
- Accelerate project time by 30-50%
- Dramatically cut errors and time for fixing them since problems are detected at compile time, not runtime
- Simplify code maintenance and rework without introducing new errors
- Increased security and robustness by reducing potential holes in code and data structures
- Easily activate the built-in performance multiplier of concurrency and multicore parallel processing
